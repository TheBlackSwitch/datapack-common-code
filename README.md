# 📝Pack Explanation:
This is a library datapack which contains code that is included in almost all my datapacks!
It's located under the namespace ``theblackswitch`` and contains code that would otherwise 
conflict with my other packs since it would be installed multiple times.

# ⭐What this pack adds:

- Movement predicates (forward, backward, jump, sneak...)
- A player ID system
- A slowtick system
- A player specific storage
- A temp score for temp values
- A server data score for server data
